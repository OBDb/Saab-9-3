generations:
  - name: "First Generation (9-3 Type 1)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The first-generation Saab 9-3, internally designated as the 9-3 Type 1, was essentially a significant development of the Saab 900 (New Generation) introduced in 1994, which itself was based on the GM2900 platform shared with the Opel Vectra. When the 900 was revised and renamed 9-3 for the 1998 model year, it received over 1,100 improvements including enhanced safety features, chassis refinements, and interior upgrades. Available as a three or five-door hatchback and a two-door convertible, the 9-3 featured distinctive Saab styling elements like the hockey stick-shaped C-pillar on hatchback models, aircraft-inspired dashboard, and center console-mounted ignition switch. Engine options included naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions of Saab's 2.0-liter and 2.3-liter four-cylinder engines, with power outputs ranging from 130 to 225 horsepower in the Viggen performance model introduced in 1999. The high-performance Viggen (named after the Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet) featured unique styling elements, sport suspension, and a 225 horsepower turbocharged engine. All 9-3 models showcased Saab's focus on safety with standard features including active head restraints (SAHR) designed to reduce whiplash injuries. The first-generation 9-3 helped solidify Saab's reputation for building cars that combined practicality, safety, and driving enjoyment with distinctive styling and aircraft-inspired design elements."

  - name: "Second Generation (9-3 Type 2)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The second-generation Saab 9-3, internally designated as the 9-3 Type 2, represented a significant departure from Saab tradition by abandoning the hatchback body style in favor of a conventional sedan when it launched in 2003. Built on GM's Epsilon platform shared with vehicles like the Opel Vectra and Chevrolet Malibu, the new 9-3 featured a more mainstream design while retaining some distinctive Saab elements such as the wraparound windshield effect, aircraft-inspired cockpit, and center console-mounted ignition. The model range initially included a four-door sedan and two-door convertible, with a five-door SportCombi wagon added in 2005. Power came primarily from turbocharged four-cylinder engines ranging from 1.8 to 2.8 liters, with outputs from 150 to 280 horsepower in the Turbo X performance model. The Turbo X, introduced in 2008, featured an electronic limited-slip differential, all-wheel drive (Saab XWD), and unique styling elements. A significant facelift in 2008 brought styling more in line with the Saab Aero X concept car, particularly in the front-end design. Despite General Motors' financial troubles and eventual sale of Saab to Spyker Cars in 2010, the 9-3 continued in production until Saab's bankruptcy in 2011. Very limited production briefly resumed under National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) ownership in 2013-2014. The second-generation 9-3 maintained Saab's reputation for safety innovation with features like active head restraints, while the driving experience emphasized the brand's traditional blend of turbocharged performance, distinctive character, and all-weather capabilityâ€”particularly in models equipped with XWD all-wheel drive. Though developed under increasing cost constraints from parent company GM, the second-generation 9-3 preserved much of Saab's unique approach to automotive design and engineering, representing the last volume-production cars from the storied Swedish manufacturer."
